## How trainees are grouped on the Register homepage

When you log into Register, on the homepage you’ll see a section called ‘Draft trainees’ and a section called ‘Registered trainees’. Under ‘Registered trainees’ there are ‘training statuses’ where trainees are grouped by:

* course not started yet (trainees who are registered but their course has not started)
* in training (all trainees currently doing training, excluding those on courses that have not started or are deferred)
* currently deferred
* awarded this year (all trainees awarded QTS or EYTS in the current academic year)
* incomplete records (registered trainees that are missing data)
