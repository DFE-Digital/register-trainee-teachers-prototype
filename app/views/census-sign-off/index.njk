      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">ITT census sign-off for the 2023 to 2024 academic year</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use this form to sign off your new trainee data. Your organisation must sign off your new trainee data on or before 31 October 2023 so it will be included in the annual initial teacher training (ITT) census publication.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">By signing off your data, you’re agreeing that:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you’ve registered all your new trainees and their data is in the Register service</li>
        <li>you’ve checked your new trainee data is correct and there are no known mistakes</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">We ask you to do this because it's important we have accurate data to use for the ITT census publication and to inform policy.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you make updates to your data after 31 October 2023, these may not be included in the ITT census publication.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Once you submit this form, we’ll update our records to show your organisation has signed off your new trainee data and it’s in Register.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you have any questions or issues that prevent you from signing off, email becomingateacher@education.gov.uk with email subject line: 2023 to 2024 signing off new trainee data.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who should sign off your data</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">A senior person from your organisation must sign off your data. This should be a different person to who submitted the data.</p>
