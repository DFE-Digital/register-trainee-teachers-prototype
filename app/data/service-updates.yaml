    title: How Register collects initial teacher training (ITT) start dates has changed
    content: >-
      When registering a trainee we were always when the trainee had started their ITT, even if the ITT had not started. Now, we will only ask when the trainee started after their ITT has started.

      You’ll need to provide a start date before you can recommend a trainee for QTS or EYTS.

    title: You no longer need to provide a lead or employing school for trainees who are employed or funded privately
    content: >-
      When you’re registering a trainee, we were asking for a lead or employing school in all cases. If a trainee is employed or funded privately, we do not need this information so we’ve added a ‘not applicable’ option to the lead and employing schools sections. You do not need to provide lead or employing schools if the trainee is employed or funded privately.
