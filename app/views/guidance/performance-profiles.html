# Sign off your list of trainees from {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} for the performance profiles publication

You need to sign off your list of trainee teachers from the {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} academic year by {{ performanceProfilesDate | govukDate('YYYY-M-D') }} at 11:59pm.

This is so that the data can be included in the annual initial teacher training performance profiles publication. This will be published on GOV.UK.

## Find your trainee data

You need a list of all registered trainees who studied in the {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} academic year. You can get this by either:

- downloading a [report with the data you need to check](/reports/performance-profiles)
- exporting a [list of registered trainees filtered to show the {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} academic year](/records?filterAcademicYears={{data.years.previousAcademicYear | urlencode }})

## Check your trainee data

Check that all your {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} trainees are listed. For each trainee you should check:

- course details
- status
- the date they were awarded qualified teacher status (QTS) or early years teacher status (EYTS), or deferred or withdrew from the course - unless they’re still studying

## Fix mistakes in your trainee data

You need to fix any mistakes before you sign off the data. How you do this depends on the type of organisation you work for.

### Providers of school centred initial teacher training (SCITTs)

If the trainee is shown in this service as awarded or withdrawn, you should email [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk?subject=Fix%20mistake%20in%202021%20to%202022%20data%20for%20performance%20profiles%20publication).

If the trainee is shown in this service as actively training or deferred, you should make the change in this service.

### Higher education institutions (HEIs)

If the trainee is shown in this service as awarded or withdrawn, you should email [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk?subject=Fix%20mistake%20in%202021%20to%202022%20data%20for%20performance%20profiles%20publication).

If the trainee is shown in this service as actively training or deferred, you should:

- make the change through the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) if the trainee was registered through HESA and is in the 2022 to 2023 initial teacher training (ITT) collection
- email [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk?subject=Fix%20mistake%20in%202021%20to%202022%20data%20for%20performance%20profiles%20publication) if the trainee was registered through HESA but is not in the 2022 to 2023 ITT collection
- make the change in this service if the trainee was not registered through HESA

## Sign off your trainee data

A senior person from your organisation must [complete a form to sign off the data (opens in a new tab)](#). This should not be the same person who entered the data.

## How your trainee data will be used

Read the [ITT performance profiles methodology (opens in a new tab)](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-performance-profiles-methodology) to find out how your trainee data will be used.

Some trainees will not be included in the ITT performance profiles publication. For example, trainees who withdrew within 90 days of the course start will not be included.
