      About the export
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This export approximates the trainees that included in the {{academicYear}} census. The census is compiled using the <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-census-methodology" class="govuk-link">Initial Teacher Training Census methodology</a>.

    <p class="govuk-body">This export includes trainees:</p>

        that are registered (no drafts)

      </li>
      <li>
        on ITT courses starting from 1 August {{ academicYearShort }}

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How the export will differ from Census</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The ITT census also excludes a small number of trainees where you have indicated they are not eligible for UK financial support and do not have a DfE allocated place. This export will not exclude them so may incllude extra trainees. Read the <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-census-methodology" class="govuk-link">Initial Teacher Training Census methodology</a> for more details.</p>
