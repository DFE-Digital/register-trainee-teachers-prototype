### How to check your trainee data in Register

There are 3 ways to do this in Register and you can choose whichever one suits you. These are:

* using the new ‘Reports’ section and exporting a CSV of your new trainees for the 2022 to 2023 academic year
* exporting a CSV of your trainees in the ‘Registered trainees’ section
* checking your trainees directly in the service one by one
