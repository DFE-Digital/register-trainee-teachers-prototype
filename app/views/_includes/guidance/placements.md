### Placements

For each of your trainees, youâ€™ll need to provide the details of at least 2 training placements in a school or early years setting.

You do not have to provide the placement details to register a trainee. For example, if you only know the details of one placement when registering a trainee, you can add the second placement later in the academic year.

You must have provided the details of at least 2 placements to recommend a trainee for QTS or EYTS by the end of their training.
