# Registering trainees through HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency)

Training providers that use HESA need to submit data through the HESA data collection system to register their trainees. Your trainee data will then be imported into Register where you can check it.

## Checking data imported into Register from HESA

Once your data has been imported into Register, you can check it. There are 2 ways to do this and you can choose whichever one suits you. These are:

* exporting a CSV of your trainees in the ‘Registered trainees’ section, using the ‘start year’ filter to select the current academic year
* checking your trainees directly in the service one by one

In the CSV export from Register, we’ve also included a column called ‘hesa_updated_at’ which shows you the last time a record was updated through HESA. You can use this column to check all your new trainees have imported into Register.

## Adding specific information to a trainee record

### How Register defines ‘withdrawn’ and ‘deferred’ trainees

A ‘deferred’ trainee in Register is a trainee who is registered on a course but then decides to defer to a later date or academic year. In Register, trainees can be deferred if they have started their ITT course or if they never start their ITT course.

In HESA ‘dormant’ trainee means the same as ‘deferred’ in Register. You can record deferred trainees in HESA by using the [Student.MODE field](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/mode).

A ‘withdrawn’ trainee in Register is a trainee that is registered on an ITT course, started that course, but then decides to withdraw from the qualified teacher status (QTS) part of the course and will not return. Trainees who are registered, but then do not start their ITT course at all, do not need to be withdrawn – their records can be deleted.

In HESA, withdrawn trainees are recorded by using the [Student.ENDDATE field](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/enddate) and the [Student.RSNEND field](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/rsnend).

### New trainee start dates

If a new trainee starts their course on or before the second Wednesday in October, you must add their trainee start date using the [COMDATE field](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/comdate) in HESA.

If the trainee starts their training late, you should also fill in the [ITTCOMDATE field](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/ittcomdate) if it’s different from the COMDATE.

If a trainee does not start their training at all, and will never start, you do not need to include them in your HESA submission.

## Recommending a trainee for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) or Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS)

When a trainee has successfully completed their training (or completed their assessment for an ‘assessment only’ route) and met the required standards, you can recommend them for QTS or EYTS in the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) portal.

{% set detailsContent %}
Once you’ve recommended a trainee for QTS or EYTS, you’ll find their record by going to the ‘Awarded this year’ training status on the Homepage. You can also filter by ‘Awarded’ on the records list page.
