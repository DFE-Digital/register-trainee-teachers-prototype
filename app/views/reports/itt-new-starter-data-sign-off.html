        This export will show the trainee data you’ve provided to the DfE for trainees starting their initial teacher training (ITT) in the {{academicYear}} academic year. We’re calling these trainees ‘new starters’.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you must do to sign off your new starter data</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use this export to check you’ve provided accurate data for all your new starters. You should check for any errors or missing trainees.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Once you’ve checked your data, a responsible officer from your organisation should sign off your ITT new starter data <a href="#" class="govuk-link">using this form</a>.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must sign off your data on or before 31 October {{academicYearShort}}.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How new starter data relates to the ITT census</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">At the start of every academic year, we (the DfE) ask you to sign off all your ITT new starter data, not just the trainee data that gets included in census. We then analyse and filter your data for the ITT census.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Not all your trainees in this export will be included in the ITT census.</p>
        
      <p class="govuk-body">To understand what data will be used for the ITT census, you can read the <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-census-methodology" class="govuk-link">Intial Teacher Training Census methodology</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">New starters without a start date</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Any trainee who does not have a start date will be included in this export. If you know they are due to start on or before the second Wednesday in October (the census date), you should add their start date as soon as you have it.
