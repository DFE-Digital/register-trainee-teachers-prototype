      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you must do to sign off your new trainee data</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use this export to check .... You should check for any errors or missing trainees.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Once youâ€™ve checked your data, a senior person from your organisation (preferably a different person to who submitted the data) should sign it off <a href="#" class="govuk-link">using this form (opens in a new tab)</a>.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must sign off your data on or before {{ performanceProfilesDate | govukDate('dddd D MMMM YYYY') }}. Not submitting and signing off trainee data by this date will mean that we (the DfE) do not have accurate data on your trainees and they may be excluded from the ITT performance profiles publication.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How trainee data relates to the ITT performance profiles publication</h2>


      <p class="govuk-body">Not all your new trainees in this export will be included in the ITT performance profiles publication. To understand what data will be used, read the <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-performance-profiles-methodology" class="govuk-link">Initial Teacher Training performance profiles methodology (opens in a new tab)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">New trainees without a start date</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Any new trainee who has a course start date on or before {{ performanceProfilesDate | govukDate}}, but does not have a trainee start date, will be included in this export.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If a new trainee starts their course on or before {{ performanceProfilesDate | govukDate }}, you should add their trainee start date as soon as possible. Not adding this means we will not know if the trainee has started their course, which could affect funding payments (if the trainee is eligible for funding).</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About this export</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">This export includes all trainees:</p>
