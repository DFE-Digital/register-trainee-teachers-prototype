      <p class="govuk-body">You must sign off your data on or before {{ performanceProfilesDate | govukDate('dddd D MMMM YYYY') }}. Not submitting and signing off trainee data by this date will mean that we (the DfE) do not have accurate data on your trainees and they may be excluded from the ITT performance profiles publication.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if you find a mistake</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-HESA trainees</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">If the trainee is still active, update the trainee in Register with the correct information. If the trainee has been awarded or withdrawn, you will need to contact us to do the update.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Performance profiles primarily focuses on trainees who finished in the year.
