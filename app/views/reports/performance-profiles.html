      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Fix mistakes</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">How you fix a mistake depends on whether you registered the trainee using HESA.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-HESA trainees</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">If the trainee is still active, update the trainee in Register with the correct information. If the trainee has been awarded or withdrawn, you will need to contact us to do the update.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Sign off your trainee data</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must sign off your data on or before {{ performanceProfilesDate | govukDate('dddd D MMMM YYYY') }}.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How trainee data is used in the ITT performance profiles publication</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Some trainees listed in the export will not be included in the ITT performance profiles publication.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">For example, trainees who withdrew within 90 days of the course start will not be included.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">To understand what data will be used, read the <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-performance-profiles-methodology" class="govuk-link">Initial Teacher Training performance profiles methodology (opens in a new tab)</a>.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Performance profiles primarily focuses on trainees who finished in the year. This report will include all trainees from the year so you can make sure that they have been correctly awardded or withdrawn or if they are continuing, that their estimated ITT end date is updated.</p>
