### How to check your trainee data in Register

There are 2 ways to do this in Register and you can choose whichever one suits you. These are:

* exporting a CSV of your trainees in the ‘Registered trainees’ section, using the ‘start year’ filter to select the current academic year
* checking your trainees directly in the service one by one
