# Sign off your list of trainees from 2021 to 2022 for the performance profiles publication

You need to sign off your list of trainee teachers from the 2021 to 2022 academic year by 31â€¯January 2023 at 11:59pm.

This is so that the data can be included in the annual initial teacher training performance profiles publication. This will be published on GOV.UK.

## Find your trainee data

You need a list of all registered trainees who studied in the 2021 to 2022 academic year. You can get this by either:

- downloading a [report with the data you need to check](/reports/performance-profiles)
- exporting a [list of registered trainees filtered to show the 2021 to 2022 academic year](/records?%5BfilterAcademicYears%5D=2021+to+2022)

## Check your trainee data

Check that all your 2021 to 2022 trainees are listed. For each trainee you should check:

- course details
- status
- the date they were awarded QTS or EYTS, deferred or withdrew from the course, unless they are still studying

## Fix mistakes in your trainee data

You need to fix any mistakes before you sign off the data. How you do this depends on whether your organisation is a:

- provider of school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT)
- higher education institution (HEI)

### If your organisation is a SCITT

You should:

- email becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk if the trainee either withdrew or has been awarded QTS or EYTS
- make the change in this service if the trainee is still studying or has deferred

### If your organisation is an HEI

For trainees who were registered through HESA, you should:

- email becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk if the trainee is no longer studying
- make the change through HESA if the trainee is still studying

For trainees who were not registered through HESA, you should:

- email becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk if the trainee either withdrew or has been awarded QTS or EYTS
- make the change in this service if the trainee is still studying or has deferred

## Sign off your trainee data

A senior person from your organisation must [complete a form to sign off the data](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOKcMGCzt4E_mlfUJl07PBbRq8Gnn6jIq_m2pv0WsnzcrKXQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). This should not be the same person who entered the data.
