# Sign off your list of trainees from {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} for the performance profiles publication

You need to sign off your list of trainee teachers from the {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} academic year by {{ performanceProfilesDate | govukDate('YYYY-M-D') }} at 11:59pm.

This is so that the data can be included in the annual initial teacher training performance profiles publication. This will be published on GOV.UK.

## Find your trainee data

You need a list of all registered trainees who studied in the {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} academic year. You can get this by either:

- downloading a [report with the data you need to check](/reports/performance-profiles)
- exporting a [list of registered trainees filtered to show the {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} academic year](/records?filterAcademicYears={{data.years.previousAcademicYear | urlencode }})

## Check your trainee data

Check that all your {{ data.years.previousAcademicYear }} trainees are listed. For each trainee you should check:

- course details
- status
- the date they were awarded QTS or EYTS, deferred or withdrew from the course, unless they are still studying

## Fix mistakes in your trainee data

You need to fix any mistakes before you sign off the data.

If the trainee is shown in this service as awarded or withdrawn, you should email [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk?subject=Fix%20mistake%20in%202021%20to%202022%20data%20for%20performance%20profiles%20publication).

If the trainee is shown in this service as actively training or deferred, you should make the change:

- make the change in this service if the trainee was not registered through HESA

## Sign off your trainee data

A senior person from your organisation must [complete a form to sign off the data](#). This should not be the same person who entered the data.
