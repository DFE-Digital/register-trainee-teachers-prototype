<p class="govuk-body">Register trainee teachers is the service that will eventually replace the Database of Trainee Teachers & Providers (DTTP) portal.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Accredited Initial Teacher Training Providers (ITT) use it to provide DfE with their trainee data.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Training providers can also perform tasks on behalf of their trainees within Register.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Those tasks include withdrawing, deferring, getting Teacher Reference Numbers (TRN) and recommending for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) or Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS).

<p class="govuk-body">DfE also uses the data for funding, the ITT census and analysis to inform policy development.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting a Teacher Reference Number (TRN)</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">When you’ve added a trainee into Register the first action you can take is to request a TRN for the trainee. This is when the trainee becomes registered.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Every teacher has a TRN and it stays with them throughout their career. It appears on their payslips and pension statements.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">They also use it to access the teacher self service portal where they can view their teacher record, view their qualifications and update personal details.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">When you’ve requested a TRN, Register will usually be updated with the TRN number within 3 days.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Assessment Only candidates will usually receive an email with their TRN. For all other routes, trainees will receive a letter. This means trainees may contact you to find out their TRN.</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Recommending a trainee for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) or Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS)</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">When a trainee has successfully completed their training (or completed their assessement for AO) and met the required standards, you can recommend them for QTS or EYTS in Register.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">DfE will usually award QTS or EYTS within 3 days.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Withdraw and defer</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Once you’ve registered a trainee, you can withdraw or defer them.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You can do this using the links on the trainee record.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Funding</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">For the ITT routes where funding applies, the data supports bursaries and scholarships, for example, it’s used to provide accurate funding to training providers.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It’s used for the funding of salary grants on the school direct salaried route. It also provides evidence for DfE when its finances are audited.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Census</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">DfE publishes an annual census of trainee teachers who are starting their training. This is so we have an indication of who will be entering the teaching workforce and can plan teacher recruitment activity.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The census happens in September and October every year.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Profiles (outcomes)</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">DfE publishes data on how many people have successfully completed their training each year.</p>
